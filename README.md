# pipe [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paulbellamy/pipe.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paulbellamy/pipe)

All the usual functional ways to work with sequences of data in Go.

## Usage

```
import "github.com/paulbellamy/pipe"
```

## Why

Because a bit of functional programming can make code a lot more readable and expressive.

## Should I Use This?

It depends. Are you ok with sacrificing some of Go's static-type-checking and compile-time safety for more expressiveness?
