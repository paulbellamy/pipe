# TODO

* Update readme
* Replace master branch
* Try it in some small example programs. (find examples of functional usage)
* Add support for slices/Maps/etc...
* Maybe look at adding an Iterable, or ISeq interface. Which one fits better? Would it make implementing map/etc easier? common interface?
* Add Iterate, and Repeatedly
