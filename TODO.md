# TODO

* Replace master branch
* Try it in some small example programs. (find examples of functional usage)
* Add others
  * MapCat
  * Min? Max? (How to do comparators?)
* Test type coercion
  * Handle variadic functions
  * Check input types match expected (chan/slice/etc)
* Drop Chan from the name of the chan methods. make them just the default? or auto-detect?
* Add benchmarks to catch silly errors
